ABSTRACT: This to-do list project is aimed at developing a full-stack web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks efficiently. The project will be built using modern web development technologies, including React for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB for data storage. The application will offer user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their respective task lists.

The to-do list application will have features such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks, setting task priorities, setting task deadlines, categorizing tasks, and marking completed tasks. Users will be able to filter their tasks based on categories, deadlines, and priority levels. The application will also include a search feature that will allow users to find specific tasks quickly.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: To develop a to-do list project using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), you will need the following software requirements:

1.Node.js and npm: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. npm is a package manager for Node.js that allows you to install and manage packages (dependencies) for your project.

2.MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides scalability, flexibility, and performance for your data storage needs.

3.Express.js: Express.js is a server-side web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of robust features for web and mobile applications.

4.React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a way to create reusable UI components that can be used in different parts of your application.

5.Code editor: You will need a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text to write and edit your code.

6.Git: Git is a version control system that helps you to manage your code changes and collaborate with other developers.

7.Command line interface (CLI): You will need to use the command line interface to install packages, start the server, and run the application.

Overall, these software requirements provide the necessary tools and frameworks for building a robust and scalable to-do list project using MERN.
